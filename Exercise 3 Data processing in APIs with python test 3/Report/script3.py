## You can use the Python request library to make a request to the Pet Store API to get the list of pets sold. You can then create a class that takes this list as an argument and has a method that counts the number of pets with the same name.
## In this code, the PetStore class has a constructor that takes a status argument indicating the status of the pets to retrieve. 
## In this case, it is set to 'sold'. The constructor also calls the get_sold_pets() method to get the list of sold pets and store it in the pets property.
## The count_pets_by_name() method loops through the list of pets sold and uses a dictionary to count the number of pets with the same name. Finally, it returns the dictionary with the name counts.
## The final code instantiates the PetStore class with the 'sold' state, calls the count_pets_by_name() method, and displays the result to the console.

import requests

class PetStore:
    def __init__(self, status):
        self.status = status
        self.pets = self.get_sold_pets()

    def get_sold_pets(self):
        url = f"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status={self.status}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        pets = response.json()
        return pets

    def count_pets_by_name(self):
        name_count = {}
        for pet in self.pets:
            name = pet.get('name')
            if name:
                if name in name_count:
                    name_count[name] += 1
                else:
                    name_count[name] = 1
        return name_count

petstore = PetStore('sold')
name_count = petstore.count_pets_by_name()

output = '{'
for name, count in name_count.items():
    output += f'"{name}": {count}, '
output = output[:-2] + '}'
print(output)
